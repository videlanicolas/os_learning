# Learning OS development

In this repo we're going to make an operating system from scratch. The bootloader, the Kernel with its syscalls, drivers, desktop environment and applications that can execute. The OS will be largely inspired in Linux, but we'll not attempt to do exactly the same, although we'll compare how Linux solves the problems that we'll eventually arrive while developing the OS.

There's no design document nor north star, we're just going to go step by step and slowly build the OS along the way. This is by no means the recommended way to make an OS, but since this repo is just for fun and learning it doesn't really matter.

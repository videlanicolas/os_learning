# Learning to make an OS
I always wanted to learn how everything in an operating system works, I learnt the theory while in university but never made one myself. This repository is released to the public domain, because I don't intend to code nor support a new OS. All the code in this repository is used for learning.

## Resources

The main resource website is [OS dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/), but in there they already say that we're going to need more resources to make an OS.
